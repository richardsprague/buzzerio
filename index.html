            As a psychotherapist, I can help you develop a new perspective and free yourself from negative beliefs.
            I use cognitive-behavioral therapy to help you understand how your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are
            connected, and to help you change them. I am a licensed Italian psychotherapist with a degree in Psychology,
            have experience working with people who are moving to new places, like other countries, and can work with you
            in English.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I can help you with emotional problems by finding how your thoughts, feelings, and actions are connected.
            My years of experience have shown how people can change their life by changing how they think. My goal is to
            help you be the best you can be in any situation. I use things like talking with you and helping you talk to
            yourself in a positive way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also use things like relaxation exercises, and teaching you to be more aware of your thoughts and feelings
            through self-instruction (such as distraction techniques and positive self-talk), relaxation and biofeedback,
            identification and refutation of negative thoughts, exercises at home, exposure therapy and mindfulness.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a licensed Italian psychotherapist, listed in the Register of Psychologists-Psychotherapists of Apulia.
            I earned a degree in Psychology from the University of La Sapienza in Rome, with a specialization in
            Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my years of study, I participated in seminars and courses related to psychotherapeutic clinical
            practice, including advanced lessons in Biofeedback at the Walden Institute in Rome, the Italian Association
            of Psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Psychology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also at the Walden Institute, I participated in seminars on learning disabilities (with specialization on
            music therapy and hippotherapy), eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Important for my
            professional development were the years of service as a psychotherapist at the ANIS (National Association for
            Social Integration) of Rome.
          </p>
          <p>
            My relational and communication skills help me understand the genuine needs of my clients. The human qualities
            of flexibility, availability, positivity, and determination that have always characterized me, combined with
            the mastery of my professional skills, allow me to pursue my intentions with passion and enthusiasm. I would be
            pleased to work with you in English, since I myself have lived in several English-speaking countries.

        <h2>On Mobility</h2>
        <p>
          I often deal with mobility, i.e., movement in general and in particular the expatriation of individuals or entire
          families. All this builds on my personal experience: for many years, I moved from one country and continent to
          another. I have directly experienced what it means to adapt to new cultures, live with loneliness for sometimes
          long periods, not have the opportunity to cultivate stable and lasting relationships, and, above all, undergo a
          personal readjustment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This involves becoming aware of the place where one is and, consequently, overcoming the feeling of being alone
          and uncomfortable in an unfamiliar environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Children, for example, despite having great adaptability, need to understand the meaning of it, assimilate it,
          and then develop it: this will give them an extra “gear” and help them in life to face the pitfalls that every
          change entails, more quickly and with more serenity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adults, on the other hand, must develop and refine their adaptability and mental flexibility more and more
          following the fracture of a balance achieved elsewhere, and called into question by every change. This process
          is not easy for some, especially since in a family, for example, one’s own balance is linked to that of the other
          family members. A psychotherapist’s assistance is essential to facilitate the future and transform what arises as
          discomfort into a point of strength.
